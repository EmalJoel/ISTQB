# Test Tools!

6.1 Test Tool Consideration
6.2 Effective use of tools


## 6.1 Tool Support for Testing

### Test tools can be used to support one or more testing activities.  Such tools include
-Tools that are directly used in testing, such as test execution tools and test data preparation tools
-Tools that help to manage requirements, test cases, test procedures, automated test scripts, test results, test data and defects for reporting and monitoring test execution.
-Tools that are used for investigation and evaluation
-any tool that assists in testing ( a spreadsheet is also a test tool by this definition)

### Test tools can have one or more of the following purpopses depending on the context
-improve the efficiency of test activities by automating repetitive tasks or tasks that require significant resources when done manually (eg test execution, regression testing)
-improve the efficiency of test activities by supporting manual test activities throughout the test process
-improve the qualify of test activities by allowing fo rmore consistent testing and a higher level of defect reproducibility
-automate activities that cannot be executed manually ( large scale performance testing )
-increase reliability of testing (eg by automating large data comparison or simulating behavior)

### Tool support for management of testing and testware
-test management tools
-requirement management tools ( traceability to test objects)
-defect manageemnt tools
-configuration management tools
-continuous integration tools (D)

### Tool support for static testing
-Tools that support reviews
-static analysis tools

### Tool support for test design and implementation
-test design tools
-test data preparation tools
-model-based testing tools
-acceptance test driven development (ATDD) & Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) tools
-Test Driven Development (TDD) tools (D)

### Tool support for test execution and logging
-test execution tools
-coverage tools (requirement coverage, code coverage)
-test harnesses
-unit test framework tools

### Tool support for performance measurement and dynamic analysis
-performance testing tools
-monitoring tools
-dynamic analysis tools

### Tool support for specialized testing needs
-data quality assessment
-data conversion and migration
-usability testing
-accessibility testing
-localization testing
-security testing
-portability testing 


### Benefits and Risks of Test Automation

### Potential benefits of using tools to support test execution include
-reduction in repetitive manual work (running regresion tests, environment setup/tear donw, re-entering the same test data and checking against coding standards ) thus saving time
-greater consistency and repeatability (test data is created in a coherent manner, tests are executed by a tool in the same order with the same frequency, tests are consistently derived from requirements)
-more objective assessments ( static measures, coverage )
-easier access to information about testing (statistics and graphs about test progress, defect rates and performance)

### Potential Risks of using tools to support testing include
-expectations for the tool may be unrealistic (including functionality and ease of use)
-the time, cost and effor tfor the initial introduction of a tool may be under estimated ( including training and external expertise)
-the effort required to maintain the test assets generated by the tool may be under estimated
-the tool may be relied on too much ( seen as a replacement for test design or execution, or the use of automated testing where manual testing would be better)
-version control of test assests may be neglected
-relationship and interoperability issues between critical tools may be neglected, such as requirements, management tols, configuration management tools, defect management tools and tools from multiple vendors
-the tool vendor may go out of business retire the tool or sell the tool to a different vendor
-the vendor may provide a poor response for support, upgrades and defect fixes
-an open source project may be suspended
-a new platform or technology may not be supported by the tool
-there may be no clear ownership of the tool ( for mentoring, updates etc)

### Special Consideration for Test Execution Tools
-a DATA DRIVEN TESTING approach separates out the test inputs and expected results, usually into a spreadsheet, and uses a more generic test script that can read the input data and execute the same test script with different data. Testers who are not familiar with scripting language can then create new test  data for these predefined scripts
-in a KEYWORD DRIVEN TESTING approach, a generic script processes keywords describing the actions to be taken ( also called action words) which then calls keyword scripts to process teh associated test data.  Testers (even if they are not familiar with the scripting language) can then define test using the keywords and associated data, which can be tailored to the application being tested.  
-Test management tools often need to interface with  other tools or spreadsheets for various reasons including
    --to produce useful information in a format that fits the needs of the organization
    --to maintain consistent traceability to requirements in a requirements management tool
    --to link with test object version infomration in the configuration management tool




## 6.2 Effective Use of Tools

### Main principals for Tool Selection
-assessment of the maturity of the organization its strenghts and weaknesses
-understanding of the technologies used by the test objects, in order to select a tool that is compatible with that technology
-evaluation of the tool against clear requirements and objective criteria
-consideration of whether or not the tool is available for af ree tiral period ( and for how long)
-Evaluation of the vendor (including training, support and commerical aspects) or support for noncommercial ( open source ) tools
-identification of internal requirements for coaching and mentoring in the use of the tool
-consideration of pros and cons of various licensing models ( commerical or open source)
-estimation of a cost benefit ratio based on concrete business use case

### pilot Project
-after completing the tool selection and a successful proof of concept, introducing the selected tool into an organization generally starts with a pilot project, which has the following objectives
    --gaining in depth knowledge about the tool, understanding both its strengths and weaknesses
    --evaluationg how the tool fits with existing processes and practices and determining what would need to change
    --deciding on standard ways of using, managing, storing and maintaining the tool and the test asset ( deciding on naming conventions for files and tests, selecting coding standards, creating libraries and defining the modularity of test suites)
    --accessing whether the benefits will be achieved at reasonable cost
    --understanding the metrics that you wish the tool to collect and report and configure teh tool to ensure these metrics can be captured and reported

### Success factors for tools
-Success factiors for evaluation, implementation, deployment and ongoing support of tools within an organization include:
    --Roling out the tool to the rest of the organization incrementally
    --adapting and improving processes to fit with the use of the tool
    --proving training ,c oaching and mentoring for tool users
    --defing guidelines for the use of the tool ( internal standards for automation)
    --implementing a way to gather useage information from the actual use of the tool
    --montoring toool use and benefits
    --proving support to the users of a given tool
    --gathering lessons learned from all users

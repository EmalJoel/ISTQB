## 2.1 - Software Development Models-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Testing within a life cycle model
-for every development activity there is a corresponding testing activity
-each test level has test objectives specific to that level
-the analysis and design of tests for a given test level should begin during the 
corresponding development activity
-testers should be involved in reviewing documents as soon as drafts are available in the
development life cycle

### V-Model (sequential development model)

-The dev activity isi divided into different phases and each phase has a series 
of tasks and has different objectives

                            <------------------

-Occurs when groups of features are specified, designed, built and tested
together in a series of cycles, often in afixed duration.  Iterations may involve
changes to features developed in earlier iterations, along with changes in project scope.




## 2.2 - Testing Levels-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Component Testing
-searches for defects in & verifies the functional of software modules, programs, objects, classes, etc
that are separately testable
-Component testing is also known as Unit, module, program, structure & code testing
-componenet testing may be required to test core functionality & specific non functional 
characteristics such as resource behavior
-typically conducted with access to the code in the form of white box testing with support of 
development environments

#### Test basis for Component Testing
-Component Requirement
-detailed design
-code

#### Typical Test Objects
-Components
-programs
-data conversion/migration programs
-database modules


### Integration Testing
-Tests interfaces between components, interactions with different parts of the system and interfaces 
between systems
-There may be more than one level of integration testing
    --component integration testing
    --System integration testing
-Systematic integration strategies may be based on the system architecture(TDA, BUA, BBA)
-The greater the scope of integration, the more difficult it becomes to isolate defects
to a specific component or system which may increase risk

#### Test basis for integration
-software & system design
-Architecture, workflows
use cases

#### Typical test objects
-subsystems
-database implementation
infrastructure, interfaces
system config & configurationd ata


### System Testing
-concerned with the behavior of the whole system/product
-the test environment shoudl correspond to the final target or production environment
to minimize the reisk of enviroment specific failure
-system testing may include tests based on risk
-testers also need to deal with incomplete or undocumented requirements
-system integration testing can be performed after system testing as well

#### Test basis for system testing
-system & software requirement specs
-functional specification
-use cases
-risk analysis report

#### Typical test objects
-system, user & operation manuals
-system configuration
-configuaration data


### Acceptance Testing
-Acceptance testing is to establish confidence in the system, parts of the system or 
specific nonfunctional characteristics of the system
-Typical forms of acceptance testing include
    --user acceptance testing
    --operational (acceptance) testing
    --contract and regulation acceptance testing
-levels of testing
    --alpha testing
    --beta testing

#### Test Basis for acceptance testing
-user & software requirement specs
-business process
-use cases
-risk analysis report

#### Typical test objects
-Business process, operational process
-user procedures
-forms, reports
-configuration data



## 2.3 - Test types-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Classification of Test Types

### Static Testing-non executable testing
    --Informal Review
    --Walkthrough
    --Technical Review
    --Inspection
-referred to as "reviews"
-Verification of code

### Dynamic Testing- executable testing
    --Component Testing
    --Integration Testing
    --System Testing
    --Acceptance Testing
-referred to as Levels of testing or functional testing
-Validation of code

### Testing of Function (Functional Testing)
-Testing the core features
-the functions are "WHAT" the system does
-comprised of Unit Testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing

### Testing of Non-Functional Characteristics
-focused on enhancing the quality characteristics of the system
-Non-Functions are "HOW" the system works
-Comprised of but not limited to performance testing, stress testing, load testing, usability testing
maintainability testing, reliability testing and portability testing

### White box Testing
-testing the program with existing knowledge of the code and structure of the program
-performed by executing the program
-aka Structure box testing, glass box testing, open box testing, clear box testing, transparent box testing

### Black Box testing
-testing without existing knowledge of how the code works or how the program is structured
-commonly performed by entering inputs at a User Interface level
-aka, skin box testing, closed box testing, opaque box testing

### Change Related Testing
-After a defect is detected and fixed, this should also be re-testing to confirm that the defect reported is successfully fixed.  This is called re-testing
-Regression Testing is the repeated testing of already tested program, after modification to checkc if there are any adverse affects on unchanged parts due to the changed part
-As regression doesn't have a primary objective of finding defects it is considered a good candidate for automation
-Regression testing is also conducted when
    --A live operational system's environment changes
    --A new functionality or feature is included to a live operational system



## 2.4 Maintenance Testing--------------------------------------------------------------

-Once deployed, a software system is often in service for years.  During this time the system, its config data or its environment are often corrected, changed or extended. 
-Modifcations include planned enhanced changes, corrective and emergency changes and changes of environment
-these include updates, upgrades, migration and retirement
-depending on the changes, maintenance testing ( regression testing) may be done at all test levels and for any or all test types

### Trigger Events
Modification-Planned enhancements, corrective and emergency changes, changes of the operational environment, upgrades of COTS software and patches for defects and vulnerabilities

### Migration
- such as from one platform to another which can require operational tests of the new environment as well as of the changed software, or tests of data conversion when data from another application will be migrated into the system being maintained

### Retirement
-such as when an application reaches EOL

### Impact Analysis
-may be done before a change is made to help decide of the change should be made,b ased on the potential consequences in other areas of the system
-Can be difficult if
    --Specifications (business requirements, user stories, archtecture) are out of date or missing
    --Test cases are not documented or are out of date
    --bi-directional traceability between tests and the test basise has not been maintained
    --tool support is weak or nonexistant
    --the people involved do not have domain and/or system knowledge
    --insufficient attention has been paid to the software's maintainability during development

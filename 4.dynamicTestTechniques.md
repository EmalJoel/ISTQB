## 4.1 | Categories of Test Design Techniques | 
### Black Box Techniques
 -AKA behavioral or behavior-based techniques
 -Characteristics of Specification based techniques are
    --Test conditions, test cases and test data are derived from a test basis that may include software requirements, specifications, usecases and user stories
    --Test cases may be used to detect gaps between the requirements and the implementation of the requirements, as well as deviations from the requirements. 
    --coverage is measured based on teh items tested in the test basis
-Techniques
    --Equivalence Partition
    --Boundary Value Analysis
    --State Transition Testing
    --Decision Table Testing
    --Use Case Testing

### White Box Testing Techniques
-AKA structural or structure based techniques
-Characteristics of Structure-based Techniques are
    --Test conditions, test cases, and test data are dervied from a test basis that may include code, software architecture,detailed design or any other source of information regarding the structure of the software
    --Coverage is measured based on the items tested within a selected structure(eg the code or interfaces)
    --Specifications are often used as an additional source of information to determine the expected outcome of test cases
-Techniques
    --Statement Testing & coverage
    --Decision Testing & Coverage

### Experience Based Techniques
-Characteristics of Experience based techniques are
    --test conditions, test cases, and test data are derived from a test basis that may include knowledge and experience of testers, developers, users and other stakeholders

-Techniques
    --error guessing
    --exploratory testing
    --checklist based testing


## 4.2 | Black Box Test Techniques  |

### Equivalence Partition
- It divides inputs into ranges (partition or class) where all the elements of a particular range are expected to behave the same
-as per EP we take just 1 test case from each range

-An integer field shall contain values and including 1-15.  By applying Equivalance partition what is the minimum number of test cases required for maximum coverage


### <1  |   1-15   |   16+     |
   ================================
       |          |           |
     X |      X   |     X     |
       |          |           |

- 3 test cases 

### Boundary Value Analysis
-BVA tests on the boundaries the defect can lie near the boundaries as well
-the values in valid range are called as valid boundary values whereas the values from invalid range are called invalid boundary values
-boundary values are calculated as LB, LB-1, RB, RB+1;  LB and RB are the lower and upper boundaries givin in the scenario 


###   invalid |   valid  |  invalid  
   ===================================
              |          |           
             X|X        X|X        
          LB-1|LB      RB|RB+1       

-A text field in an application accepts inputs as the age of the user.  H3ere the values allowed by the filed are between 18 to 30 inlcuding both values.  BY applying Boundary Value analysis what is the minimum number of test cases required for maximum coverage.  
    

### Decision Table Testing
-Captures system requirements that contain logical conditions
-The specification are analyzed and conditions and actions of the sytsem are identified in a tabular form
-the input conditions and actions are most often stated in a way taht they must be true or false


                testcase1   testcase2   testcase3   testcase4
conditions
cond 1          true         true       false       false
cond 2          true         false      true        false
actions
action            x             x           x           x


### State Transition Testing

-State Transition testing exhibits the various states of scenario /system and possible transition between them
-The representation is called State Transition Diagram (STD)
-An STD shows all Valid Transitions
-An STD consists of a pair of transitions between 2 states
-if the pair is missing between 2 states then the missing transition(s) is (are) called Invalid Transitions
   
  A       B
S1----->S2----->S3
S1<-----S2<-----S3
    D        C


     A          B

### Use Case Testing

-Use case testing describes interaction between actor and systtem
-it is helpful for deriving test cases for the interation testing, system testing and acceptance testing


                            Step        Decision
Main Success                1           A: Inserts Card            
Scenario                    2           S: Validates Card and asks for PIN
A: Actor                    3           A: Enters Pin
S: System                   4           S Validates Pin
                            5           S: Allows access to account
____________________________________________________________________________

Extensions                  2a          Card not valid
                                        S: Displays message and reject card
                            
                            4a          PIN not valid
                                        S: Display message and ask for re-try(twice)

                            4b          PIN invalid 3 times
                                        S: Eat card and exit



-Use case describes the "process flows" through a system based on its actual use
-use case helps to uncover defects in process flow during real world use of the system
-it also helps uncover intergration defects caused by the interaction and interference of different components
-use case are described at the abstract level ( business use case, business process level)
-use case may also be described at the system level (system use cases on teh system functionality level)



## 4.3 | White Box Testing Techniques  |

-Statement Testing or statement coverage tests the statement for a given fragment of code
-whereas decision testing or decision coverage tests the decisions made within a given fragment of code
-decision tersting is also known as branch testing or branch coverage testing
-decision testing is stronger than statement testing
-100% decision coverage guarantees 100% statement coverage but not vice versa

### Statement Coverage

Read A
Read B
If A>B then 
    print "A is bigger"
Else
    print "B is bigger"
End If

-What is the minimum # of test cases required for 100% statement coverage
-Statement Coverage = minimum number of paths required for covering all nodes


Start
 1              2
 |   A,B        |         
 |               -----------
 |   A,B -> False >         |
 |                  |       |
 |                  |       |
 |  A               B       |
 |                  |       |
 |                  |       |
 |   -----<---------<       |
 |                          |
 |  End IF       ------------
 |              |
 | End          |
                |

2 statement paths required to get 100% coverage


Example 1
wait for card to be inserted
If card is valid then 
    display "enter pin"
    if Pin is Valid th3en
        Select Transaction
    Else (otherwise)
        display "Pin Invalid"
Else(otherwise)
    reject card


Wait

Reject------Valid-----------Select 
Card        Pin             Transaction
|             |                 |
|           Display             |
|           pin invalid         |
|             |                 |
|             |                 |
|_____________|_______________ end

3 statement paths to get 100% coverage
Tip-Statement coverage = 1 + count of else



 -For the given fragment of code following paths/test cases have been executed.  What statement coverage is achieved.  
Test 1- A,B,C
Test 2- A,B,D,G,H

A-50%
B-75%****
C-90%
D-100%


                    A

    \       |
     \______G___________H
            |
            I

Statement       Number of Statements Executed
          =     ______________________________

Coverage        Total Number of statements     

6 over 8 = 75%


### Decision Coverage 
-Statement Testing or statement coverage tests the statement for a given fragment of code
-Whereas decision testing or decision coverage tests the decisions made within a given fragment of code
-decision testing is also known as Branch testing or branch coverage
-decision testing is stronger than statement testing
-1--% decision coverage guarantees 100% statement coverage but not vice versa

ex 1
Read A
Read B
If A>B then 
    print "A is bigger"
Else
    print "B is bigger"
End If

-What is the minimum # of test cases required for 100% statement coverage
-Decision Coverage = minimum # of paths required for covering all  the branches

## 4.4 | Experience Based Test Techniques |
-Experience based techniques uses testers skill, intuition and experience of similar application and technologies
-These Techniques are useful in identifying special tests which are not easily captured by formal techniques
-These techniques are usually applied after applying formal techniques
-There are a few scenarios where these are the only option to apply
    --Specifications are poorly defined
    --time pressure
    --testing team is not formally trained on testing fundamentals (joel raises hand)
    
Error Guessing
-This technique requires knowledge of defects and experience of application
-is to enumerate possible defects and design tests that attach these defects
-this systematic approach is called fault attack
-these defect and failure lists can be built based on experience, typical defect and failure data
-updating the result of execution and evaluation further need of tests and their execution
-error guessing based on 
    --how the application has worked in the past
    --what types of mistakes the developers tend to make
    --failures that have occured in other applications

-Here it includes a part of the application which supposed to be explored
-in exploratory testing, informal (not pre-defined) tests are designed, executed, logged and evaluated dynamically during test execution.  
-These don't require preparation of test cases instead a random or ADHOC approach is followed
-test charter containing test objectives are the basis to be followed for execution
-the execution are time boxed with a range between 30  min to 120 min depending on the size of the application
-executions are called test sessions or timeboxed test sessions

Checklist Based Testing
-testers design, implement and execute tests to cover test conditions found in a checklist
-as part of analysis,testers create a new checklist or expand an existing checklist but testers may also use an existing checklist without modification
-checklists can be built based on experience, knowledge about what is important for theuser or an understanding of why and how software fails
-in the absense of detailed test cases, checklist based testing can provide guidelines and a degree of consistency
-as these are high leve lists, some variability in the actual testing is liekly to occur resulting in potentially greater coverage but less repeatability.

## Static Testing 

### 3.1 Basics
LIMITED TO NON EXECUTABLE CONTENT
Almost any work product can be examined using static testing (reviews and/or static analysis) for example:
-Specifications, including business requirements, functional requirements and security requirements
-Epics, User stories and acceptance criteria
-architecture and design specifications
-code
-testware, including test plans, test cases, test procedures, and automated test scripts
-user guides
-web pages
-contracts, project plans, schedules and budgets
-models, such as activity diagrams, which may be used for model based testing

### benefits
-When applied early in software development lifecycle, static testing enables the early detection of defects before dynamic testing is performed.  
-E.G in requirements or design specification reviews, product backlog refirement etc
-Defects found early are often much cheaper to remove than defects found later in the lifecycle, especially compared to defects found after the software id deployed and in active use.   

### additional benefits
-detecting and correcting defects mroe efficiently and prior to dynamic test execution
-identifying defects which are not easily found by dynamic testing
-preventing defects in design or coding by uncovering inconsistencies, ambiguities, contradictions, omissions, inaccuracies and redundancies in requirements
-increasing development productivity (e.g due to improved design, more maintainable code)
-reducing development cost and time
-reducing testing cost and time
-reducing total cost of quality over the software's lifetime due to fewer failures later in the lifecycle or after delivery into operation
-improving communication between team members in the course of participating in reviews. 

### Static vs Dynamic Testing

One main distinction is that statis testing finds defects in work products directly rather than identifying failures caused by defects when the software is running. 

Compared with dynamic testing, typical defects that are easier and cheaper to find and fix through static testing include
    --requirement defects ( e.g. inconsistencies, ambiguities, contraditions, omissions, inaccuracies and redundancies)
    --Design defects ( inefficient algorithms or database structure, high coupling, low cohesion)
    --coding defects (eg. variables with undefined values, variables that are declared but never used, unreachable code, duplicate code)
    --deviations from standards (e.g. lack of adherence to coding standards)
    --Incorrect interface specifications (e.g. different units of measurement used by the calling system than the called system)
    -security vulerabilities (e.g suceptibility to buffer overflows)
    --gaps or inaccuracies in test basis traceability or coverage (e.g missing tests for an acceptance criterion)

## 3.2 Review Process

### Activities of Review Process
-Planning
-Initiate Review
-individual review
issue communication and analysis
fixing and reporting

#### Planning
-Defining the scope, which includes the purpose of the review, what documents or parts of documents to review, and the quality characteristics to be evaluated
-estimating effort and timeframe
-identifying review characteristics such as the review type with roles activities and checklists
-selecting the people to participate in the review and allocating roles
-defining the entry and exit criteria for more formal review types ( e.g inspections)
-checking that entry criteria are met (for more formal review types)

#### initiate review
-distributing the work product and other material, checklists and related work products
-explaining the scope, objectives, process, roles and work products to the participants
-answering any questions that participants may have about the review

#### individual review
-reviewing all or part of the work product
-noting potential defects, recommendations and questions

#### issue communication and analysis
-communicating identified potential defects (eg in a review meeting)
-analyzing potential defects, assigning ownership and status to them
-evaluating and documenting quality characteristics
-evaluating the review findings against the exit criteria to make a a review decision (reject; major changes needed; accept, possibly with minor changes)

#### fixing and reporting
-creating defect reports for those findings that require changes
-fixing defects found ( typically done by the author) in the work product reviewed
-communicating defects to the appropriate person or team ( when foudn ina work product related to the work product reviewed)
-recording updated status of defects ( in formal reviews), potentially including the agreement of the comment originator
-gathering metrics ( for more formal review types)
-checking that exit criteria are met ( for more formal review types)
-accepting the work product when the exit criteria are reached

### Roles and Responsibilties of a formal review

#### Author
 creates the work product under review
 fixes defects in the work product under review

#### Management
-is responsible for review planning
-decides on the execution of reviews
-assigns staff, budget and time
-monitors ongoing cost effectiveness
-executes control decisions in the event of inadequate outcomes

#### Facilitator (Moderator)
-ensures effective running of review meeting
-mediates, if necessary between the various points of views
-is often the person upon whom the success of the review depends

#### review leader
-takes overall responsibility for the review
-decides who will be involved and organizes when and where it will take place

#### Reviewers
-may be subject matter experts, persons working on the project, stakeholders with an interest in the work product and/or individuals with specific technicall or business backgrounds
-identify potential defects in the work product under review
-may represent different perspectives (eg tester, programmer, user, operator, business analysit, usability expert etc)

#### Scribe (recorder)
-organizes potential defects found during the individual review activity
-records new potential defects, open points and decisions from the review meeting (when held)


### Types of Reviews
-informal review
-walkthrough
-technical review
-inspection

#### informal review
-no formal process
-may take the form of pair programming
-technical lead reviewing designs and code
-varies in usefulness depending on the reviewer
-main purpose: inexpensive way to get some benefit


#### walkthrough
-meeting led by author
-may take the form of scenarios, dry runs, peer group participation
-open ended session
    --optional pre-meeting preparation
    --optional preparation of review report
-scribe is optional
-may vary in practice from quite informal to formal
-main purpose: learning, gaining understanding, finding defects


#### Techical Review
-documented, defined defect-detection process
-includes peers & techinical experts ( with optional management participation)
-may be performed as peer review
-ideally lead by trained moderator
-pre-meeting preparation by reviewers
-optional use of checklist
-preparation of review report by scribe
-may vary in practice from quite informal to formal
-main purpose: discussing, making decisions, evaluating alternatives, finding defects, solving technical problems and checking conformance to specifications, plans, regulations and standards


#### inspection
-led by trained moderator
-usually conducted as peer examination'
-defined roles
-includes metrics gathering
-formal process based on rules and checklists
-specified entry and exit criteria
-pre-meeting preparation
-inspection report including list of findings
-formal follow-up process
-main purpose: finding defects


### applying review techniques

#### ad hoc review
in an ad hoc review, reviewers are provided with little to no guidance on how this task should be performed
-reviewers often read the work product sequentially, indentifying and documenting issues as they encounter them
-ad hoc reviewing is a commonly used technique needing little preparation
-this technique is highly dependent on reviewer skills and may lead to many duplicate issues being reported by different reviewers

#### checklist based 
-a checklist based review is a systematic techniuqe, whereby the reviewers detect issues based on checklists that are distributed at review initiation
-a review checklist consists of a set of questions based on potential defects, which may be derived from experience.  
-the main advantage of the checklist based technique is a systematic coverage of typical defect types
-care should be taken not to simply follow the checklist in individual reviewing but also to look for defects outside the checklist

#### scenario and dry runs
-reviewers are provided with structured guidelines on how to read through the work product
-scenario based approach supports reviewrs in performing "dry runs" on the work product based on expected usage of the work product ( if the work product is documented in a suitable format such as use cases). 

#### Role Based
-a technique in which the reviewers evaluate the work product from the perspective of individual stakeholder roles. 
-typical roles include specific end user types ( experienced, inexperienced, senior, child, etc ), and specific roles in the organization (user administrator, system administrator, performance tester, etc)

#### perspecitve based
-in perspective based reading, similar to role based review, reviewers take on different stakeholder viewpoints in individual reviewing.  Typical stakeholder viewpoints include end user, marketing, designer, tester or operations
-in addition, perspective based reading also requires the reviewers to attempt to use the work product under review to generate the product they would drive from it
-empirical studies have shown perspective based reading to be the most effective general technique for reviewing requirements and techinical work products

#### Success factors
-each review has a clear objective, defined during review planning, and used as a measureable exit criteria
-review types are applied which are suitable to achieve the objectives and are appropriate to the type and level of software work products and participants
-any review techniques used, such as checklist based or role based reviewing are suitable for effective defect identification in the work product to be reviewed
-any checklists used address the main risks and are up to date
-large documents are written and reviewed in small chunks so that quality control is exercised by proving authors early and frequent feedback on defects
-participants have adequate time to prepare
-reviews are sheduled with adequate notice
-management supports the review process

#### The people factor
-the right people are involved to meet the review objectives, for example people with different skill sets or perspectives who may use the document as a work input
-testers are seen as valued reviewers who contribute to the review and learn about the work product, which enables them to prepare more effective tests and to parepare those tests earlier
-participants dedicate adequate time and attention to detail
-the review is conducted in an atmosphere of trust; the outcome will not be used for the evaluation of the participants
-particpants avoid body language and behaviors that might indicate boredom, exasperation or hostility to other participants
-adequate training is provided especially for more formal review types such as inspections. 
-a culture of learning and process improvement is promoted
